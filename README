This is a multi-threaded CPU and GPU miner for bitcoin.

License: GPLv2.  See COPYING for details.

Dependencies:
	libcurl			http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/
	jansson			http://www.digip.org/jansson/
	(jansson is included in-tree and an installed one may conflict)

Basic *nix build instructions:
	To build with GPU mining support:
	Install AMD APP sdk, latest version - there is no official place to
	install it so just keep track of where it is if you're not installing
	the include files and library files into the system directory.
	(Do NOT install the ati amd sdk if you are on nvidia)

	./autogen.sh	# only needed if building from git repo
	CFLAGS="-O3 -Wall -march=native" ./configure
	or if you haven't installed the ati files in system locations:
	CFLAGS="-O3 -Wall -march=native -I<path to AMD APP include>" LDFLAGS="-L<path to AMD APP lib/x86_64> ./configure
	make
	
	Note that you need to use /x86_64 for 64bit and /x86 for 32bit builds
	If it finds the opencl files it will inform you with
	"OpenCL: FOUND. GPU mining support enabled."

Basic WIN32 build instructions (on Fedora 13; requires mingw32):
	./autogen.sh	# only needed if building from git repo
	rm -f mingw32-config.cache
	MINGW32_CFLAGS="-O3 -Wall -msse2" mingw32-configure
	make
	./mknsis.sh
	
Native WIN32 build instructions (on mingw32, on windows):
	Install AMD APP sdk, latest version
	(Do NOT install the ati amd sdk if you are on nvidia)
	Install mingw32
	Install libcurl, copy libcurl.m4 into /mingw/share/aclocal
	Run:
	autoreconf -fvi
	CFLAGS="-O3 -Wall -msse2 -I<path to AMD APP include>" LDFLAGS="-L<path to AMD APP lib/x86>" ./configure
	make

Usage instructions:  Run "cgminer --help" to see options.

The output line shows the following:
[(5s):204.4  (avg):203.1 Mh/s] [Q:56  A:51  R:4  HW:0  E:91%  U:2.47/m]

Each column is as follows:
A 5 second exponentially decaying average hash rate
An all time average hash rate
The number of requested work items
The number of accepted shares
The number of rejected shares
The number of hardware erorrs
The efficiency defined as the accepted shares / requested work
The utility defines as the number of shares / minute
